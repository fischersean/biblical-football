# Biblical Football



A reddit comment gave me this idea. The basic premise is that you can use the scores of an NFL/CFB game as the chapter and verse of a given book of the Bible. Most of the time it gives gibbrish but occasionally it is pretty amusing. 



**For example**, 

​		ATL vs NE, 28 - 34

​		So that thou shalt be mad for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see.



### Issues

The select options break when the number of valid books differs greatly from one week to the next. I'm not sure why.
